fix: remove Linux support for simplified platform maintenance (v0.25.1)

- Remove Linux support from export functionality to focus on Windows and macOS
- Simplify cross-platform logic in ExportHandlers and HandlerRegistry classes
- Add explicit platform validation with clear error messages for unsupported systems
- Update default export paths: Windows uses ~/Documents/Figma Exports, macOS uses ~/Downloads/Figma Exports
- Update README.md platform support section to reflect Windows/macOS only
- Add platform requirements section to DEVELOPMENT.md with clear system prerequisites
- Update plugin UI version to v0.25.1 for consistency
