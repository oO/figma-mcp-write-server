## 💡 Usage Guidelines

### Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: "Create a 200x50px blue button" works better than "make a button"
2. **Use Exact Values**: Specify colors (#FF0000), sizes (16px), and positions (x: 100, y: 50)
3. **Reference Existing Elements**: "Apply the same style as the header" when possible
4. **Describe Relationships**: "Center the text within the button" for layout context

### AI Agent Instructions

When instructing AI agents:

- **Start with Action Verb**: "Create", "Move", "Apply", "Set", "Generate"
- **Specify Tool Context**: Mention when working with specific design systems or components
- **Include Constraints**: "Keep the text readable" or "Maintain brand colors"
- **Request Validation**: "Check that the spacing follows the 8px grid"

### Common Workflows

1. **Design System First**: Create styles and variables before applying to components
2. **Components Then Instances**: Build the component library, then create instances
3. **Layout Then Content**: Set up frames and layout before adding specific content
4. **Measure and Export**: Add annotations and export specifications for development handoff

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Tool Response Format

All tools return structured YAML data within MCP's text response format:

```yaml
operation: create
nodeType: rectangle
nodeId: "123:456"
properties:
  width: 200
  height: 100
  x: 0
  y: 0
  fillColor: "#007AFF"
message: "Rectangle created successfully"
```

### Bulk Operations

Many tools support bulk operations by passing arrays:

- **Single**: `nodeId: "123:456"`
- **Bulk**: `nodeId: ["123:456", "123:457", "123:458"]`

### Error Handling

If operations fail, AI agents receive clear error messages:
- "Node not found: invalid-id" for missing elements
- "Font not available: CustomFont" for missing fonts
- "Plugin not connected" for connection issues
