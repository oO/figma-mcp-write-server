  - Updated Figma plugin to be WebSocket client that connects to MCP server
  - Fixed port configuration inconsistencies (standardized on 8765)
  - Removed broken plugin-client.ts and bridge architecture
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive cleanup and accuracy improvements
  - Removed exaggerated claims ("breakthrough", "first ever", "novel")
  - Fixed help text references to non-existent files
  - Updated architecture descriptions to match actual implementation
  - Removed redundant PROJECT_SUMMARY.md file
  - Fixed typos and improved navigation between documentation files
- **Plugin**: Enhanced Figma plugin implementation
  - Added proper WebSocket client with auto-reconnection
  - Improved error handling and visual status indicators
  - Added font loading for text creation operations
  - Enhanced UI with real-time connection monitoring

### Changed
- **Architecture**: Simplified to direct MCP server â†” Plugin communication
  - MCP server now includes built-in WebSocket server
  - Plugin connects as WebSocket client (eliminates bridge complexity)
  - Consistent port configuration (8765) across all components
- **Code Structure**: Cleaned up unused files and inconsistent references
  - Removed plugin-client.ts (functionality moved to mcp-server.ts)
  - Updated help text and documentation to match actual file structure
  - Fixed TypeScript imports and dependencies

### Technical Details
- **Port**: Standardized on 8765 for WebSocket communication
- **Connection**: Plugin auto-connects to MCP server on startup
- **Error Handling**: Improved timeout and reconnection logic
- **Logging**: Better status reporting and debugging information

## [1.0.1] - 2025-05-28

### Fixed
- **Critical**: Fixed JSON parsing errors in MCP protocol communication
  - Redirected decorative console output from stdout to stderr
  - Prevented emoji-decorated log messages from interfering with JSON-RPC protocol
  - Resolved parsing errors: "Unexpected token 'ðŸŽ¨'", "ðŸš€ Startin", "ðŸ”— Connect", etc.
  - Maintained all debug logging functionality while ensuring MCP compliance
- Updated files: `src/index.ts`, `src/mcp-server.ts`, `src/bridge-client.ts`

### Technical Details
- Root cause: Console messages with emojis/decorations were being sent to stdout
- Solution: Changed `console.log()` to `console.error()` for non-JSON output
- Impact: Eliminates connection issues between Claude Desktop and MCP server
- MCP protocol requires stdout to contain only valid JSON-RPC messages
