## [0.18.0] - 2025-01-27

### Changed
- **🔧 MCP Protocol Compliance**: Fixed all MCP tools to return raw JSON data instead of formatted display text
  - All tools now return structured JSON data that AI agents can programmatically parse and use
  - Removed human-readable formatting from tool responses (emojis, formatted strings, content wrappers)
  - Tools return direct data structures from plugin responses instead of wrapping them in display format
  - Error handling converted from formatted error messages to proper exception throwing
  - Affects all tools: get_page_nodes, get_selection, export_node, create_node, update_node, manage_nodes, manage_styles, manage_auto_layout, manage_constraints, manage_hierarchy, get_plugin_status, get_connection_health

### Technical Details
- Removed `content: [{ type: 'text', text: '...' }]` wrapper objects from all tool responses
- Changed methods to return `response.data` or `result.data` directly
- Updated error handling to throw exceptions instead of returning formatted error objects
- Maintains all functionality while ensuring MCP protocol compliance for AI agent consumption

### Why This Matters
- AI agents need structured data to programmatically work with results
- Formatted text is for humans, not MCP tool consumers
- Parsing formatted strings is brittle and error-prone
- MCP protocol expects JSON responses that agents can directly use
