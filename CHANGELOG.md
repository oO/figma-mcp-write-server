## [0.9.2] - 2023-12-15

### Fixed
- **Architecture**: Fixed broken communication between MCP server and Figma plugin
  - Implemented WebSocket server directly in MCP server (port 8765)
  - Updated Figma plugin to be WebSocket client that connects to MCP server
  - Fixed port configuration inconsistencies (standardized on 8765)
  - Removed broken plugin-client.ts and bridge architecture
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive cleanup and accuracy improvements
  - Removed exaggerated claims ("breakthrough", "first ever", "novel")
  - Fixed help text references to non-existent files
  - Updated architecture descriptions to match actual implementation
  - Removed redundant PROJECT_SUMMARY.md file
  - Fixed typos and improved navigation between documentation files
- **Plugin**: Enhanced Figma plugin implementation
  - Added proper WebSocket client with auto-reconnection
  - Improved error handling and visual status indicators
  - Added font loading for text creation operations
  - Enhanced UI with real-time connection monitoring

### Changed
- **Architecture**: Simplified to direct MCP server â†” Plugin communication
  - MCP server now includes built-in WebSocket server
  - Plugin connects as WebSocket client (eliminates bridge complexity)
  - Consistent port configuration (8765) across all components
- **Code Structure**: Cleaned up unused files and inconsistent references
  - Removed plugin-client.ts (functionality moved to mcp-server.ts)
  - Updated help text and documentation to match actual file structure
  - Fixed TypeScript imports and dependencies

### Technical Details
- **Port**: Standardized on 8765 for WebSocket communication
- **Connection**: Plugin auto-connects to MCP server on startup
- **Error Handling**: Improved timeout and reconnection logic
- **Logging**: Better status reporting and debugging information

## [1.0.1] - 2023-12-10

### Fixed
- **Critical**: Fixed JSON parsing errors in MCP protocol communication
  - Redirected decorative console output from stdout to stderr
  - Prevented emoji-decorated log messages from interfering with JSON-RPC protocol
  - Resolved parsing errors: "Unexpected token 'ðŸŽ¨'", "ðŸš€ Startin", "ðŸ”— Connect", etc.
  - Maintained all debug logging functionality while ensuring MCP compliance
- Updated files: `src/index.ts`, `src/mcp-server.ts`, `src/bridge-client.ts`

### Technical Details
- Root cause: Console messages with emojis/decorations were being sent to stdout
- Solution: Changed `console.log()` to `console.error()` for non-JSON output
- Impact: Eliminates connection issues between Claude Desktop and MCP server
- MCP protocol requires stdout to contain only valid JSON-RPC messages

## [1.0.0] - 2023-12-01

### Added
- Initial release of Figma MCP Write Server
- WebSocket bridge architecture for plugin communication
- 13 MCP tools for full Figma write access:
  - `create_rectangle` - Create rectangle shapes
  - `create_ellipse` - Create ellipse/circle shapes  
  - `create_text` - Create text elements
  - `create_frame` - Create frame containers
  - `update_node` - Update existing node properties
  - `move_node` - Move nodes to new positions
  - `delete_node` - Delete nodes
  - `duplicate_node` - Duplicate existing nodes
  - `get_selection` - Get currently selected nodes
  - `set_selection` - Set node selection
  - `get_page_nodes` - List all nodes on current page
  - `export_node` - Export nodes as images
  - `get_plugin_status` - Check plugin connection status
- Figma plugin with UI thread WebSocket connection
- TypeScript implementation with full type safety
- Zod schema validation for all tool inputs
- Real-time heartbeat monitoring
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- CLI interface with configurable options
- Complete setup documentation

### Changed
- Refactored plugin communication to use WebSocket bridge instead of direct MCP server WebSocket
- Moved WebSocket connection from plugin main thread to UI thread for better compatibility
- Simplified message handling by removing redundant UUID generation
- Updated architecture to separate concerns between bridge and MCP server

### Fixed
- Plugin connection issues by moving WebSocket to UI thread (Figma plugins have network restrictions in main thread)
- TypeScript compilation errors with WebSocket imports
- Message routing between plugin and MCP server
- Heartbeat mechanism for stable connections

### Technical Details
- **Architecture**: MCP Server â†” WebSocket Bridge â†” Figma Plugin â†” Figma API
- **Transport**: stdio for MCP, WebSocket for plugin communication
- **Languages**: TypeScript, JavaScript
- **Dependencies**: @modelcontextprotocol/sdk, ws, zod, uuid
- **Compatibility**: Node.js 18+, Figma Desktop, MCP clients (Claude Desktop, etc.)

### Security
- Local-only WebSocket connections (localhost:8765)
- Plugin runs in Figma's sandboxed environment
- Message validation using Zod schemas
- No sensitive data stored in plugin code
