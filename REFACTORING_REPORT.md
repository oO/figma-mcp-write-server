# Figma MCP Write Server: Architecture Refactoring Report

**Report Date:** 2025-06-24  
**Version:** v0.29.0  
**Analysis Scope:** Full codebase architecture, Agent Experience (AX), and maintenance optimization

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive analysis of the Figma MCP Write Server identifies critical opportunities to improve Agent Experience (AX), reduce maintenance overhead, and enhance long-term architectural sustainability. The current system, while functional with 24 MCP tools and robust handler architecture, suffers from tool fragmentation, architectural inconsistencies, and complexity that impacts both AI agent usability and developer productivity.

**Key Findings:**
- **Limited consolidation opportunity** - 83% of tools already use multi-operation patterns (24 → 21 tools max)
- **Dual handler architecture** creates maintenance complexity and developer confusion
- **Type system explosion** with 12+ operation files showing significant redundancy
- **Inconsistent error handling** patterns impacting Agent Experience quality
- **Missing bulk operations** creating major workflow friction for agents
- **Ambiguous naming** causing confusion in multi-server environments

**Recommended Investment:** High-impact refactoring focusing on Agent Experience optimization and architectural simplification, with an estimated 40% reduction in maintenance overhead post-implementation.

## Part 1: Architecture Refactoring

### Current Architecture Pain Points

#### 1. Tool Fragmentation and Naming Issues
**Problem:** 24 tools with `manage_` prefix create Agent Experience friction
- Semantic ambiguity in multi-server environments
- Related operations split across multiple tools
- Cognitive load from decision paralysis

#### 2. Dual Handler Architecture Complexity
**Location:** `src/handlers/` + `figma-plugin/src/handlers/`  
**Problem:** Two different handler patterns serving different layers
**Impact:** Developer confusion, code duplication, testing complexity

#### 3. Type System Explosion
**Problem:** 12 operation files with significant redundancy
**Impact:** Maintenance burden, large bundle size, developer cognitive load

#### 4. Error Handling Inconsistencies
**Problem:** Different error handling approaches across layers
**Impact:** Inconsistent agent experience, debugging difficulties

#### 5. Over-Engineered WebSocket Protocol
**Problem:** Complex batching, queueing, retry logic for typically sequential operations
**Impact:** Unnecessary complexity, difficult testing, potential race conditions

### Limited Consolidation Opportunities

The analysis reveals that the current architecture is **already highly consolidated**, with 83% of tools using multi-operation patterns. Further consolidation has limited benefits:

#### Realistic Consolidation Targets

**Merge Node Operations → `figma_nodes`**
- **Current:** `create_node` (single-purpose), `update_node` (single-purpose), `manage_nodes` (3 operations)
- **Proposed:** Single `figma_nodes` with operations: `create`, `update`, `move`, `delete`, `duplicate`
- **Impact:** Adds 2 operations to existing multi-operation tool
- **Benefits:** Unified node operations interface

**Merge Selection Operations → `figma_selection`**
- **Current:** `get_selection` (single-purpose), `set_selection` (single-purpose), `get_page_nodes` (single-purpose)
- **Proposed:** Single `figma_selection` with operations: `get_current`, `set_nodes`, `get_page_hierarchy`
- **Impact:** Combines 3 single-purpose tools into 1 multi-operation tool
- **Benefits:** Eliminates selection workflow fragmentation

#### Why Layout Consolidation Would Be Problematic

**Layout Tools Are Already Optimally Structured:**
- `manage_auto_layout`: 4 specialized operations for auto-layout configuration
- `manage_constraints`: 4 operations for responsive design constraints  
- `manage_hierarchy`: 4 operations for grouping and organization
- `manage_alignment`: 3 operations for positioning and distribution

**Merging these would create a mega-tool with 15+ operations**, making it harder to use and maintain. The current domain-specific separation provides better Agent Experience.

#### Dev Tools Should Remain Separate

**Current dev tools are logically distinct:**
- `manage_annotations`: 4 operations for design annotations
- `manage_measurements`: 4 operations for spacing/sizing specs  
- `manage_dev_resources`: 5 operations for CSS generation and dev status

Each serves different development handoff workflows and should remain separate for clarity.

### Tool Naming Convention Improvements

#### Current `manage_` Prefix Problems
1. **Semantic ambiguity** - Could refer to any management system
2. **Loss of domain context** - No clear Figma identification  
3. **Cognitive load** - Agents must read descriptions for context

#### Proposed `figma_` Prefix Benefits
```yaml
# Clear domain identification:
manage_text → figma_text           # Obviously Figma text operations
manage_styles → figma_styles       # Obviously Figma styling
manage_components → figma_components # Obviously Figma components
```

**Industry Alignment:**
- `github_repos`, `slack_messages`, `shopify_products`
- Clear domain prefix pattern already established

### Architecture Simplification

#### Handler Pattern Unification
**Goal:** Adopt BaseHandler pattern across all layers
- Consistent operation registry pattern
- Unified parameter validation
- Standardized error handling

#### Error Handling Standardization
**Goal:** Single error response format across all tools
- Consistent error wrapping
- Predictable error recovery for agents
- Unified error utility functions

#### Type System Consolidation
**Current Problem:** 12 operation files (~1,645 lines) with 15-20% redundancy
- 80+ enum definitions with variations (LEFT vs 'left', UPPER vs 'upper')
- 50+ duplicate property patterns (nodeId, position, size repeated across files)
- Similar validation logic implemented differently across operations

**Solution: Three-Phase Consolidation Strategy**

**Phase 1: Extract Common Enums and Constants**
```typescript
// New file: src/types/figma-enums.ts
export const FigmaEnums = {
  TextAlign: {
    horizontal: z.enum(['LEFT', 'CENTER', 'RIGHT', 'JUSTIFIED']),
    vertical: z.enum(['TOP', 'CENTER', 'BOTTOM']),
  },
  TextStyle: {
    case: z.enum(['ORIGINAL', 'UPPER', 'LOWER', 'TITLE']),
    decoration: z.enum(['NONE', 'UNDERLINE', 'STRIKETHROUGH']),
  },
  ExportFormats: z.enum(['PNG', 'JPG', 'SVG', 'PDF']),
  ScaleModes: z.enum(['FILL', 'FIT', 'CROP', 'TILE']),
} as const;

// Replace 20+ duplicate definitions across files
```

**Phase 2: Create Reusable Field Mixins**
```typescript
// New file: src/types/common-fields.ts
export const CommonFields = {
  // Used in 8+ files currently
  nodeId: z.string().optional(),
  nodeIds: z.array(z.string()),
  
  // Position/size patterns repeated 6+ times
  position: z.object({
    x: z.number().optional(),
    y: z.number().optional(),
  }),
  size: z.object({
    width: z.number().optional(), 
    height: z.number().optional(),
  }),
  
  // Visual properties with consistent validation
  opacity: z.number().min(0).max(1).optional(),
  rotation: z.number().optional(),
};

// Mixin composition pattern
export const withPosition = <T extends z.ZodRawShape>(schema: T) =>
  z.object({ ...schema, ...CommonFields.position.shape });
```

**Phase 3: Operation Schema Factory**
```typescript
// New file: src/types/operation-factory.ts
export function createOperationSchema<T extends z.ZodRawShape>(
  baseOperations: readonly string[],
  additionalOperations: readonly string[],
  fields: T,
  validationRules?: Record<string, (data: any) => boolean>
) {
  return z.object({
    operation: z.enum([...baseOperations, ...additionalOperations] as [string, ...string[]]),
    ...fields,
  }).refine((data) => {
    const rule = validationRules?.[data.operation];
    return rule ? rule(data) : true;
  });
}

// Usage in operation files
const ManageStylesSchema = createOperationSchema(
  ['create', 'list', 'apply', 'delete', 'get'], // Standard CRUD
  [], // No additional operations
  {
    styleId: z.string().optional(),
    styleName: z.string().optional(),
    ...CommonFields.nodeId,
  },
  {
    apply: (data) => !!data.nodeId && !!data.styleId,
    create: (data) => !!data.styleName,
  }
);
```

**Expected Results:**
- **300-400 lines reduction** (20-25% decrease in type definition size)
- **Single source of truth** for all Figma enums and common patterns  
- **Consistent validation** across all 24 tools
- **Easier maintenance** - enum updates in one place instead of 8+ files
- **Better type safety** through shared, tested definitions

### Refactoring Results Summary
**Before:** 24 tools with `manage_` prefix  
**After:** 22 tools with `figma_` prefix (minimal consolidation)  
**Tool Reduction:** 8% fewer tools (24 → 22) - architecture already well-optimized  
**Primary Benefit:** Clear domain naming, not quantity reduction  
**Functionality:** 100% preserved  
**Naming:** Clear domain identification for multi-server environments

## Part 2: New Feature Development

### Bulk Operations Implementation

#### Current Bulk Support Assessment

**✅ Tools with Full Bulk Support (5/24 tools):**
- `manage_alignment` (3 operations) - Align/distribute multiple nodes
- `manage_boolean_operations` (4 operations) - Boolean ops on multiple shapes
- `manage_exports` (has `export_bulk` operation) - Bulk export operations
- `manage_hierarchy` (has `group` operation) - Group multiple nodes
- `set_selection` (single-purpose) - Select multiple nodes

**❌ Multi-Operation Tools Lacking Bulk Support (15/24 tools):**
- `manage_styles` (5 operations) - `apply` operation works on single node only
- `manage_text` (5 operations) - All text operations are single-node
- `manage_components` (7 operations) - Component creation and management single-node
- `manage_instances` (6 operations) - Instance operations single-node
- `manage_auto_layout` (4 operations) - Auto-layout configuration single-frame
- `manage_constraints` (4 operations) - Constraint setting single-node
- `manage_images` (11 operations) - Image operations single-node
- `manage_fonts` (9 operations) - Font operations don't apply to multiple nodes
- And others...

**❌ Single-Purpose Tools Lacking Bulk Support (4/24 tools):**
- `create_node`, `update_node`, `get_selection`, `get_page_nodes`
