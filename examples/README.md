## 🎯 How to Use These Examples

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure your Figma MCP server is running and connected
2. **Natural Language**: Give instructions to your AI agent in plain English
3. **Follow Along**: Each example builds on previous concepts
4. **Experiment**: Try variations and modifications of the examples
5. **Check Results**: Visual illustrations show expected outcomes

## 🖼️ Visual Examples

All examples include visual illustrations located in the [`./images/`](./images/) directory. These images are created using the MCP server itself to demonstrate real output and expected results.

## 📝 Example Format

Each example follows this structure:
- **User Intent**: What you want to accomplish
- **Instructions**: Natural language commands to give your AI agent  
- **AI Actions**: What the MCP server does behind the scenes
- **Visual Result**: Screenshots or illustrations of the output
- **Tips**: Best practices and common variations

## 🔄 Interactive Examples

Many examples can be run directly by giving the natural language instructions to your AI agent. The AI will use the MCP tools to create the designs in your connected Figma file.

## 🚦 Workflow Recommendations

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with [Getting Started](./getting-started.md) examples
2. **Build Systems**: Progress to [Design System](./design-system.md) for reusable components  
3. **Master Layout**: Learn [Layout System](./layout-system.md) for responsive designs
4. **Advanced Techniques**: Explore [Advanced Operations](./advanced-operations.md) for complex workflows
5. **Professional Output**: Use [Export Workflows](./export-workflows.md) for production assets
